# Discord Auto Publisher
Automatically publish messages or news in your announcement channels!

A lightweight bot that will automatically publish every new message in your announcement/news channels to other servers who follow it. An excellent solution for servers who rely on bots (such as RSS feeds) to publish their news, allowing your moderators to get some rest from manual publishing.

Bot features no commands because the setup is really easy!

**How to set up?**
1. Invite the bot to your server: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=739823232651100180&permissions=10240&scope=bot
2. Navigate to your announcement channel's settings and give bot the following permissions: Read Messages, Send Messages, Manage Messages
3. Repeat step 2. for every channel where you want auto-publishing
4. Done!

**Keep in mind!**
* Bot can only publish 10 messages per hour (just as users), this is rate limited by Discord!
* If you want to stop the bot from publishing messages in any of your announcement channels, just remove it's permissions in channel settings.
